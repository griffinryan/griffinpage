Steadily garnering respect in the Seattle electronic scene, this fresh voice arrived completely up to the challenge of opening for not just one, but two local favorites. Actively cutting beats and introducing some live instrumentation caught everyone’s attention. Anything less than what was delivered would have fallen flat, but Torpoise’s clear-cut talent lived up to the night’s unusually high expectations.",
