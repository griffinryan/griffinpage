## Build

To host the web application locally, clone this repository and cd into it.

    git clone https://github.com/torpoise/torppage.git

    cd torppage/

The app for [https://torpoise.com/](https://torpoise.com/) is built on React.js.
This means we can use Node.js (or specifically npm) to interact with it.

To host the web application locally, test, etc.

    npm start
    
    npm test

    npm install

    npm run build

You can also use yarn here instead.

    yarn start

    yarn build



'npm start' starts hosting the web application on a development server at [http:/localhost:3000](http:/localhost:3000)

'npm install' installs required or dependencies for React.js project.

`npm run build` will build the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
